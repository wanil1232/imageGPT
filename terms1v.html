Description of the App: </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c16 c2">2.1 AI-Based Image and Video Generation</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c3">The App sends textual prompts or uploaded images to external AI services (e.g., Leonardo, OpenAI GPT-Image-1) to produce, enhance, or edit images, and may also generate videos using external video AI services such as Runway (RunwayML). For example, image editing features are powered by OpenAI GPT-Image-1, and video generation features are powered by Runway.</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c4">I do not control these external services and cannot guarantee the quality, availability, or legality of their outputs.</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c3">2.2 Tokens The App uses &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; as an internal currency for creating images. When your token balance is depleted, you must either wait for any available</span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c3">free auto-renew token system (if offered) or purchase additional tokens to continue generating images. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c3">2.3 Local and Cloud Storage </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c3">Generated images are stored locally on your device. References (such as image metadata and URLs) and user account information are stored on Supabase cloud servers, which may be hosted outside your country of residence. This may result in the transfer of your data internationally. While best efforts are made to secure your data, the Developer disclaims liability for data loss due to service failure or misconfiguration. </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c3">2.3.1 Important note regarding editing images in the edit screen &ndash; no cloud backup</span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c3">Certain files, data and edits &ndash; including but not limited to temporary versions, in-progress image edits, masks, previews and history &ndash; are not backed up to the cloud and remain solely on your device.</span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c3">In particular, edited images and temporary data created using the image editing features (such as those powered by OpenAI GPT-Image-1) are not uploaded or stored in Supabase or any other cloud service for backup or privacy purposes.</span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c3">If you uninstall the app, clear app data or your device deletes these local files, this content may be permanently lost and cannot be restored. If you wish to back up edited images or work in progress, you are responsible for manually exporting and saving them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c3">2.4 Updates &amp; End of Support I may release updates from time to time to improve functionality or address issues. You agree to download and install these updates promptly to maintain full compatibility. I also reserve the right to discontinue or limit support for older versions of the App or certain operating systems at any time, with or without notice. In such cases, the App may cease functioning as expected on those outdated platforms. </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c2">2.5 Third-Party Services<br></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The App integrates with external services (e.g., Leonardo AI, OpenAI GPT-Image-1, Runway, Supabase, Google Play). These services are operated by third parties under their own terms and privacy policies. I am not responsible for service interruptions, limitations, or policy changes from these providers.</span></p><p class="c26 c39"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c70"><span class="c16 c2">2.6 Data Retention and User Deletion Requests </span></p><p class="c83"><span class="c3">All user-related data&mdash;including token usage logs, image metadata, fingerprint identifiers, and account activity&mdash;is stored securely in the Supabase cloud database. Unless otherwise required by law, this data is retained </span><span class="c16 c2">indefinitely </span><span class="c3">for operational continuity and user access history. </span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c3">You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting the Developer via the email listed in Section 8.1. While such requests will be honored in good faith, please note: </span></p><p class="c54"><span class="c3">Deletion may take time depending on Developer availability. No guarantees are made as to immediate processing. By using the</span></p><p class="c94"><span class="c3">App, you acknowledge that data removal may be delayed or deferred indefinitely unless and until the Developer becomes available to address the request. </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c3">2.6.1 Data Deletion Timeframe </span></p><p class="c81"><span class="c3">Requests for account or data deletion will be processed within 30 business days, subject to the Developer&rsquo;s availability. In exceptional circumstances, processing time may be extended, but all efforts will be made to honor requests in a timely manner. </span></p><h2 class="c57" id="h.63k7rnzahqnd"><span class="c16 c18">3. Account &amp; Fingerprint</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c2">3.1 FingerprintID &amp; User Identification<br></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Upon first launch, the App generates a unique technical identifier (&ldquo;fingerprintID&rdquo;) for your device using the official Android interface for device identification (not via WebView or external browser authentication). This fingerprintID serves as your user account ID in the App and in the Supabase database.<br> </span><span class="c16 c2">You do not need to create or remember a username or password. There is currently no built-in method to back up or restore your account by standard authentication.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">If you need to restore access to your previously created images, data, or tokens from a lost or reinstalled device, you may contact support and provide your unique &ldquo;Secret Backup ID,&rdquo; which is displayed in the App settings under the option &ldquo;Secret Backup Identifier.&rdquo;<br> </span><span class="c16 c2">Upon contacting customer support and providing the required information and verification, your tokens and any images previously backed up to the cloud can be transferred to your new account.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">If you do not consent to this method of identification, please do not use the App.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">3.1.1 Cookies, Device Signals, and Fingerprinting Notice<br></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The App uses the Android system interface and/or official fingerprinting libraries (such as FingerprintJS) to generate a device-based identifier. This process may rely on device signals, system APIs, or other technical methods to create a unique signature.<br> While this identifier does </span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;include personally identifiable information (PII), users should be aware that such identification may be subject to privacy and data regulation laws. By using the App, you consent to this process. The Developer does </span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;track, share, or sell this data to third parties.<br> For more information, see FingerprintJS Terms of Service.- </span><span class="c2 c66">https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/terms-of-service</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">3.1.2 No Personal Information in FingerprintID<br></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The fingerprint-based identifier generated by the App does </span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;contain names, email addresses, government IDs, or precise geolocation data. It is strictly a technical signature for account creation and linking within the App.<br> If future versions of the App include identifiers or information that may qualify as PII under applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), </span><span class="c16 c2">explicit user consent will be obtained before enabling such features.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c2">3.2 No Liability for Account Issues<br> The Developer disclaims responsibility for account compromises, data loss, or inability to recover an account if your device&rsquo;s fingerprintID is lost, changed, or reset.<br> If you lose access to your device and do not have your Secret Backup ID, your account and its associated content may not be recoverable. You are responsible for complying with any local laws requiring disclosure about device fingerprinting or data usage; your continued use signifies your acceptance.</span></p><p class="c6 c26"><span class="c16 c2"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c16 c50"></span></p><h2 class="c69" id="h.nnq2pk5pmqh"><span class="c16 c18">4. Purchases &amp; Subscriptions</span></h2><p class="c15"><span class="c2">4.1 In-App Purchases (Token Packs)<br></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You can buy token bundles through Google Play Billing. Successful purchases add tokens to your balance. If tokens are deducted incorrectly or a generation fails, I am not automatically obliged to reimburse you. You may contact me (Section 8), but no guarantee of remedy is provided.<br> Tokens granted or purchased within the App are considered a limited, non-transferable license to access specific features, and not a property right or digital asset. The Developer retains full ownership and control over all tokens and may revoke them at any time in accordance with these Terms.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">4.2 Auto-Renew Subscription<br></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The App may offer an automatically renewing subscription (e.g., tokens_1000_monthly) that provides tokens and/or premium features on a recurring basis.<br> </span><span class="c4 c17">Subscription Selection:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;By checking the box labeled &quot;Receive the package every month (Auto-Renew)&quot; during purchase, you confirm selection of a recurring subscription. This activates Google Play&rsquo;s billing cycle.<br> </span><span class="c17 c4">Cancellation:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You can cancel the subscription at any time via your Google Play account settings. If canceled, no further charges will be made after the current billing cycle.<br> </span><span class="c17 c4">Token / Benefit Duration:<br></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Tokens received from the subscription remain in your account unless removed according to other provisions in these Terms (e.g., Sections 7.2 or 8.6). This clause does not override the Developer&rsquo;s reserved rights to revoke or reset balances.<br> Any additional benefits (such as increased generation quality, style access, or extended usage rights) will remain active for a limited period of time following each benefit activation. If no renewal occurs, those benefits may be removed without further notice.<br> </span><span class="c17 c4">No Immediate Refund:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Unless required by Google Play or local law, no partial refunds will be provided if the subscription is canceled during its active cycle.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">4.3 One-Time Purchases (Non-Recurring)<br></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you do not check the auto-renew option, your purchase will be treated as a one-time transaction, not linked to recurring charges. This includes token packs or any single-use unlocks.<br> </span><span class="c17 c4">Token / Benefit Duration:<br></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Tokens from the one-time purchase remain in your account unless used or removed in accordance with other terms outlined in this document. In case of conflicts, provisions granting the Developer authority to reset or remove tokens shall take precedence.<br> Additional features (such as HD quality, advanced styles, or extended usage rights) will be accessible for a reasonable duration from the date of purchase. After that time, such features may be automatically revoked unless repurchased.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">4.4 Refunds &amp; Cancellations<br></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Google Play&rsquo;s policies apply to all billing, refunds, or subscription cancellations.<br> </span><span class="c17 c4">No Partial Refunds:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Unless required by law, partial refunds for unused time or benefits will not be issued.<br> </span><span class="c17 c4">Subscription Cancellation Effect:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Typically, you will retain benefits until the end of your paid usage period. After that, no additional benefits will be provided unless a new purchase is made.</span></p><p class="c15 c26"><span class="c16 c32"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c32">4.5 Strict Refund Limitation on Token Use<br></span><span class="c62">You may request to cancel your subscription or one-time purchase, and may seek a refund, </span><span class="c16 c25">provided that you have not used any of the tokens in the app for any action or feature within the App.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c11">However, the first use of any Token after the package has been purchased - no matter how minor or partial - will permanently terminate your right to cancel, revoke, or request a refund for that purchase. This applies to both recurring and one-time Token packages, as well as all associated benefits. If you use any Tokens after purchase, you waive any right to a refund or cancellation for that transaction, in full and forever.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c62">To request a cancellation or refund, you must contact the Developer directly at the official support email:<br></span><span class="c16 c25">&nbsp;igptstpportimagecreator@gmail.com</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c11">All refund or cancellation requests will be reviewed at the sole and exclusive discretion of the Developer, who reserves the right to determine whether to grant a cancellation, issue a refund, or provide an alternative remedy, regardless of user preference or request.</span></p><p class="c15 c26"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">4.6 Auto-Renew Toggle Option<br></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;During the purchase process, a checkbox labeled &quot;Receive the package every month (Auto-Renew)&quot; will be presented.<br> If checked, your transaction becomes a subscription with periodically recurring benefits and charges (see Section 4.2).<br> If unchecked, the purchase will be processed as a single one-time pack with limited-time benefits (see Section 4.3).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c44"></span></p><h2 class="c43" id="h.2kc62b60mmo0"><span class="c16 c18">5.
